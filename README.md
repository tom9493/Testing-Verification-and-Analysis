# CS329
These are the projects done in CS329 -- Software Testing, Analysis, and Verificaiton. We used junit5 to write numerous tests for a fairly complicated framework.
The tests were all encompassing: Black-box, white-box, MC/DC coverage, etc.
We used an abstract syntax tree library to implement constant propogation and type checking. Functionally, this allows us to examine code and rewrite it to be simpler
and more efficient at runtime. It also ensures that variables of different types do not interact inappropriately.
We also used dafny, which allow us to write code and test it simultaneously using ensures, requires, modifies, and other clauses to ensure functions do what they are intended to.
